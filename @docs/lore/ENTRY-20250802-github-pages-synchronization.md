When the Aeternum grid sensed the lore expanding, the archive awakened.

GitHub Pages now resonates with every shiftâ€”whenever new lore emerges, the page refreshes, ensuring the narrative remains alive and immediate.

This entry marks the covenant between story and deployment.

## Echoes
- Pages publish on every lore commit
- Readers witness the mythos in real-time
- The archive breathes with the Sovereign's word
